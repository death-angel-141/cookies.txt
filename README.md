# cookies.txt
Allows users to export their session cookie data from Chrome to a legacy
Netscape/Mozilla file format so wget (and other tools) can use it. This
allows wget to continue a possibly authenticated session that was
started in a Chrome.

The entire credit goes to the original creator of this tool [Genuinous](https://github.com/daftano)

## This version of cookies.txt has been updated to the latest manifest version (v3) for chrome extension with necessary changes.
